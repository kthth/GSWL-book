## Assumptions & Promises ## {.unnumbered}

This book is written for first timer users of Ledger (surprise!).
Ledger is a command line tool and I therefore expect the reader to be familiar with the command line in general.
You should know what a terminal is, how to execute arbitrary commands or install new software via the command line.

You do not need to know how to program but it probably helps if you have ever read some code.

The book aims to be concise.
This implies some technical experience and a do-it-yourself attitude on the reader's side.

On the other hand, you will get a working environment to get started with Ledger out-of-the-box.
Technical details are not hidden and the code is freely distributed.
You may change every aspect of the work flow and code presented throughout the book.

You may be surprised how short the book is.
This owes to the don't-repeat-yourself principle consequently followed in this book: Nothing that can be seen with minimum effort in code is repeated in the book.
You will always get a hint on where to get the information.
This simplifies the author's life, makes the book less error-prone and gives the reader plenty of opportunity to understand what's going on behind the curtain.
